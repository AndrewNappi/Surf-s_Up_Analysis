# Challenge 9 Written Report

## Overview:

    The reason for this analysis is to give more info on weather trends because our client wants 
to open a surf shop and if the temperature is bad all year then the idea is a non starter. and 
the client wants to have data for june and december, this will tell us if a ice cream/ surf shop 
is a good buisness idea for the area.

##Results:

- In the analysis we notice that Decembers average temp is lower than Junes average temperature.
-Junes max temperature is potentially 85 degrees, while Decembers average temerature could max 
out at 83.
-While decembers min temperature is 56 degrees. which is a bit colder than junes min temperature.

##Summary
    To conclude, because our average temperatures for December and June are so similar only differing by 3 degrees. This means our clients idea of a hybrid ice cream and surf shop is a rather good idea.
